# Game Genre Prediction from Screenshots and Descriptions
### In this project, we developed a model to predict game genres using both game screenshots and textual descriptions. For extracting features from the game descriptions, we utilized BERT, a state-of-the-art transformer-based model for natural language processing. BERT allowed us to capture the contextual meaning of the descriptions, ensuring robust feature extraction.
### For the game screenshots, we employed ElasticNet, a regularized regression model, to extract and select relevant features from the images.
